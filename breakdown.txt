thank you thank you everyone thank you for coming can you hear me okay good good
0:12
um yeah I see a few familiar faces some of you are probably at the gala last night I'm hoping my voice holds me for
0:18
this full duration of this talk apologies in advance if it doesn't um so yeah I just want to thank
0:25
raindance quickly for allowing us to sponsor the event this is our first time doing this and it's been incredibly
0:31
exciting and thank you all for coming and if you haven't heard about Celtics before you'll find out a little bit
0:36
today some of you might have already had and you've referred to it as Celtics we hear that a lot but it's Celtics
0:44
um so yeah let's let's get into it so we're doing a script breakdown Master
0:50
Class I'm not going to cheat my own horn with the mat I'm not a master of breakdown but I will uh get into it
0:57
um quickly the agenda so we're just going to do a quick intro on the history of Celtics how we came to be where we're
1:03
based as little as possible about myself um and then we're going to get into what
1:08
is breakdown why does it matter why is it of a benefit particularly to screenwriters like I always like to
1:14
judge the crowd here of who here is a screenwriter raise their hands
1:19
anybody like a hyphenated writer producer writer director Jack of all
1:26
there we go see so breakdown is going to be super beneficial to to everyone basically
1:33
um then we're going to talk a little bit about Ye Old way of doing breakdown which if you you want to do it you can
1:40
maybe if you're into typewriters it's something you might want to do is the old manual way of breakdown but it's
1:46
interesting to see done and then we're going to Pivot and we're going to go into the Celtic's way of doing breakdown which you'll often see some
1:52
commonalities between our competitors as well there's definitely a standard a standardized way of doing breakdown and
1:58
then we're going to get into a sample script and actually do some breakdown and then we'll have some time for a q a
2:05
on your seats there there is a trial that you can try Celtics out for a month
2:10
are like highest tier plan so if you're curious about that we would love for you
2:16
to give it a try and I'll have my email at the end would love to hear any feedback as well so without further Ado
2:22
let's get into it so about Celtics our mission is to improve storytelling and collaboration for creating film video
2:30
and of late games we've actually gotten into the interactive narrative writing space which is really really interesting
2:36
and also very interesting a lot of screenwriters are making their foray into game writing so maybe you know next
2:43
year or something at rain dance there can be a session about that definitely would love to come back over to the UK so I'm just plugging that
2:50
right now we are established in 1999 so we've been around the block for a while if you've been a screenwriter for a
2:56
while you might you might remember that we had a desktop software so we moved from a desktop app because we received a
3:03
ton of feedback about collaboration was brutal when it came to having a desktop version so we moved to the cloud in 2012
3:10
we were one of the first screenplay writing softwares to do that and in that
3:15
time we have over 5 million users to date we have 50 000 active creators per
3:21
week and there's about 70 000 new projects created per monthly so that allows us to gain tons of insight tons
3:28
of feedback from writers all over the world has been translated into 55 languages um so yeah it's a really great company
3:35
to work for and we're super amped to be here um just to give you some reference we're
3:41
east east coast Canada so that's that little island in the circle there and
3:46
all the rest of that's Canada so we're actually closer to you guys we're just you know literally a hop across the pond
3:52
than we are to to the to the rest of Canada um fun fact we were a British colony
3:57
until 1947 and the vote to become a part of Canada got through by like a Razor's
4:03
Edge so we still really love our teddly tea there's pictures of the queen on the wall we we definitely still have roots
4:12
and there's just a few pics of home um very I've been to Cornwall it's very reminiscent of somewhere like Cornwall
4:18
it's a we don't like I don't know what the Sheep picture is about because like that's not how we get to work and stuff
4:24
like we do have cars we we do have a city um and about me
4:31
um so I've been working with Celtic since 2015 prior to that um I had a past life for for several
4:39
stressful years as a junior producer and content producer for a production company based out of St John's
4:45
um the thing with Newfoundland is we have a crazy good tax credit compared to the rest of Canada
4:50
um and as indie film producers and creators you know that those tax credits you go after them as much as you
4:56
possibly can so we do get a lot of Productions there so that allowed me to
5:01
um kind of it was a little bit of baptism by fire the first show I worked on was a CBC series which is the
5:08
equivalent to the BBC in Canada than a Netflix series trees and then I I delved
5:14
into reality TV which spoiler alert there are scripts for every episode of reality TV including the bachelor
5:22
um so yeah it was really great to do that and then I kind of made my own foray and I wrote and produced a short
5:27
film it was a passion project to me got by on a 30 000 Canadian budget which
5:33
probably equates to like 10 pounds here because our dollar is just so bad compared to you guys
5:40
um so that was a really great learning experience as well and then Celtics kind of came to me my life and I've been
5:45
there ever since and I lead the product teams there my guilty pleasure movie is any Irish comedy with like a hint of
5:53
like sentimental values so waking that Divine is like my go-to and my fave
5:59
London restaurant is flesh and buns in Covent Garden we just went through the other night the Celtics crew highly recommend if you're if you're new to
6:06
London so that's me let's get into script breakdown
6:11
so at Celtics and generally in the industry we kind of see production as
6:16
three phases so at Celtics we refer to writing and story ideation so the story
6:22
development that you do whether it's your index cards mood boards anything of that nature all falls under story
6:28
development and then you get into script writing As you move into pre-production this is breakdown this is budget
6:35
budgeting this is some scheduling and then once you get into production that is where the rubber is hitting the road
6:41
and you're doing your call sheets you're you're there you're on the Fly you're doing your end of days your day out of
6:47
days so Celtics does actually cover every single aspect of that process what
6:53
we're most well known for is our screenplay writing editor
6:58
um so what exactly is a script breakdown well in the most General sense it's a thorough analysis of a script that
7:04
identifies and categorizes all elements needed to properly prepare for the production process
7:11
um in plain terms it's literally going line by line scene by scene Page by Page and you are breaking down every single
7:18
requirement that you will possibly need in every department for for that and the benefits of it it's
7:26
a crucial step in pre-production as I think I already mentioned but it helps isolate all the elements you need and
7:31
then you can further break them down by Department it gets your crew and your departmental keys ready and it helps
7:39
generate a shooting schedule it helps generate your script sides and it helps you get talking to your DP about your
7:45
shot list it's kind of like the very Cornerstone and Foundation of beginning
7:50
to get into that pre-production process um and how can it help you as a
7:56
screenwriter or a hyphenated individual writer producer producer director from
8:01
an indie perspective breakdown can guide your writing to match the resources you possess or you hope to possess right
8:10
um you know it's a little bit a way of like hacking your own writing when you can get into breakdown and get into your
8:16
costs if you're shopping your film around you're looking for a producer you've got to have a Keen Eye on are you
8:22
writing for your budget and breakdown helps you do that I remember in my short film I had this scene that I was going
8:28
to need like a car mount and I it it was really well written but then what ended
8:34
up happening was it's okay the car can be parked in a parking lot um he can just rest his head on the
8:41
steering wheel and it worked because that was the budget that we had so I was able to kind of from the producer
8:47
perspective an ad perspective go back and rework my script to match the resources that I had I mean hope
8:53
hopefully you never end up in that position and I hope you get a big envelope of money for script development and you never have to think about that
9:00
but you know that's just the nature of it and it really helps in early discussions with potential producers
9:06
that if you can talk to your script in a logistical way given your breakdown it really gets the
9:13
conversation flowing with producers who you might potentially hire as the ever important role of the first ad and your
9:20
departmental keys right you should be able to send a script and a breakdown if you're trying to woo
9:26
someone to be a departmental key or first ad
9:31
um small segue here because I love talking about this and I'm not going to say it was all because of breakdown because it definitely wasn't but
9:39
um there's quite a few rain dance connections here one of the best documentaries I've ever watched on how a
9:44
production can go terribly awry potentially due to lack of planning but
9:49
also like the cosmic joke that is the universe is a documentary called Lost in La Mancha and the connection here is
9:56
Terry Gillum that way back in 1997 he had this passion project to create the
10:01
legend of Don Quixote and I believe up until I think 2015 was his first shot at
10:09
production and it everything went wrong luckily he had a documentary crew with
10:16
him that filmed the documentary lost in La Mancha and it is hands down one of the most hilarious heartbreaking
10:23
Odysseys into filmmaking that you will ever watch um and I highly highly recommend it and
10:29
the Rain Dance Connection there well there's tons of them is eventually I believe in 2017 well back in 2015 they
10:36
ended up seizing production the film didn't get made the legend of Don Quixote they just stopped it and then in
10:42
2017 he brought it back to life again and who should start it with sir Jonathan price who won the icon award
10:49
last night along with Adam Driver and the same documentary crew that film Lost in La Mancha came back and they shot
10:57
another doc which I believe in 2019 won an award at the rain dance for best doc
11:03
so whole series High highly recommend both documentaries really great foray
11:09
into switching from the writing to the production process more of a lesson of
11:15
like not what to do than what to do but highly highly recommend
11:20
all right so who conducts the script breakdown in the early days like I said producers producers or you know
11:27
hyphenated individuals writer producers will also will often do a scale down production but once the pre-production
11:33
stage begins it is your first ad that first ad is such a crucial incredibly
11:40
important role on so many levels but particularly when it comes to breakdown like that individual has to have an
11:47
obsession with the details and they assume the responsibility of the breakdown so
11:54
um often they'll do the first version of it and then as your departmental keys come on board they become obsessed with
12:00
their own version of breakdown so say you've got your art department and back home in Canada that would include props
12:06
sets set dressing Greenery the art department will do a specific art Department breakdown but the end goal is
12:13
having a clear shooting schedule that every Department knows what they need and on the topic of a first aid I have a
12:19
really close friend his name is George Jeffrey he is an awesome A.D he works
12:24
out of Toronto I feel like he shot he aided all of shit's creek he works on feature films just all around super
12:31
awesome cool dude so I asked him to give me a few words on what breakdown means
12:37
to him as a first aid so I'm gonna play that now hey how's it going my name is George
12:43
Jeffrey I'm a first ad I work in Canada and I'm just going to talk a little bit about uh breakdowns that I do and how it
12:52
relates to receiving a script and just the importance of uh of how those two come together and how we take uh take
12:58
what's on the page to the floor uh a big one for me uh when I'm doing my breakdowns is receiving a production
13:05
white script uh uh that way we can lock scene numbers which is uh super important and move forward with Asterix
13:13
is that it'll indicate changes on the different colors of the script so that's a big one for us of course each scene
13:19
needs a breakdown so uh it'll be c number followed by set description and
13:24
then either day or night certainly a big part of it in the set description it'll indicate whether you know Hotel bedroom
13:30
and or uh you know country road that kind of thing interior exterior that'll help
13:36
to set up the schedule uh scripts broken down usually by 1 8 of
13:42
a page so uh formatting's big for us you know sometimes uh the headers and the Footers and the margins get massage to
13:49
be bigger to get more words on the page and that'll uh that can sometimes prove challenging Because by the end of a
13:55
feature film script there's just more than what the average formatting is
14:00
asking for breaking it down by 1 8 of a page becomes one nine for one tenth and
14:05
you could end up with an extra half day of shooting as a result of that so that can be tricky so formatting is a big part of it for us also uh in the
14:12
formatting world it would be uh all the information that's at the top what color
14:18
you're on in terms of revision uh and a date that's associated with it is always
14:24
good and then you carry the scene that you're in if it's more than one page you carry the c number of course from page to page
14:30
thank you George um so yeah he touched on a few crucial things there that I kind of wanted to
14:36
get the the perspective of an A.D before digging into them and doing the demo
14:42
um so one of those hey how's it going my name is
14:49
so yeah he made a few key points here that I'm gonna I'm gonna get into um 1 8 of a page do folks deeply
14:57
understand what that means when it comes to scheduling because it's a little a little bit of mine screw to wrap your
15:03
head around but it comes from it originally being an ultra manual process
15:08
so I think most of us know the general rule of thumb when it comes to screen
15:13
time is one page of script equates to one minute but in the scheduling World
15:19
completely different scenario um it's we schedule everything as 1 8 it
15:26
seems to be the universal way of scheduling and getting your page counts for the day so the manual versus
15:33
automated way is literally let me show you here
15:39
then I'll jump back so the manual way of doing a script
15:44
breakdown would have been let you see this literally lining the script by eighths
15:51
that's where that comes from and the logic to that is when you line
15:57
your script by 1 8 and you start dividing your script your scene lengths
16:02
up by 1 8. that gives you a really good indicator of how long how much you can
16:08
get in a day so general rule of thumb for a feature is you can get anywhere from three to five pages a day in
16:15
production again depends on the complexity of the scene the amount of setups but that is
16:20
generally A good rule of thumb for example really dialogue heavy scenes with multiple players like multiple
16:26
characters if it's three pages you should just be aiming to do that one scene that day
16:32
same goes for um notoriously like I said driving stuff
16:38
um lucky if you get two pages that day so it is a really good rule of thumb to
16:44
follow everything by one ace the great thing about doing it automate it in Celtics is you don't even have to think
16:49
of fractions like I I hate fractions and it we do it for you so you can just go
16:55
ahead and do your breakdown and then as you get into scheduling as you get into your call sheets we bring over and count
17:01
those eighths for you so at the end it just spits out look this this is how many scenes you're trying to do this is
17:08
going to add up to being 5 and 1 8 or 5 and 2 8 that day
17:13
another thing he talked about is script visioning colors now I did a bit of research on this because I know it can vary
17:19
um but I go by the writer's Guild of America way I don't know if in the UK the versioning control is different my
17:27
research tells me that it isn't but George mentioned that at a bare minimum he needs a production white to begin
17:33
optimally you would get into like before your departmental keys get super super involved you get into like locking your
17:40
script and get into revision mode so that generally means as you move towards
17:46
um you know having the most complete version of your script before shoot day you work through these colors so you
17:53
start with version one is blue and you work all your way through to version nine and what ends up happening is if
17:59
you make changes throughout so say you change a scene and again in Celtics this is automated when you go into revision
18:05
mode if you change the dialogue in the scene if you change a description of the scene you'll start seeing these
18:10
asterisks by that scene and that is for your crew that is for your keys that is
18:16
to like send out the bat signal something's changed here from the last time you read that script you should
18:22
read it you should ensure your breakdown is correct you should ensure you're going to have what you need for that scene so again it's something that
18:29
Celtics does and and automates and that's the beauty of getting away from the paper waste Stitch is you can just
18:35
be sending versions of this out like sporting as PDFs sending it out I remember I worked in a production office
18:41
at the the production budget for paper usage was over 50 was over 50 Grand per
18:48
season and then we would break it down further because you actually end up printing on the legit color so we would
18:55
need like a salmon colored paper which is significantly more money than white paper so go digital it's it's the best
19:03
way you can possibly especially as an indie filmmaker don't get tied up in all that paper wastage no no one wants that
19:09
anyway right so let's talk about breakdown categories Celtics takes it a little bit of a step
19:15
further we have a few extra categories there but generally across the board in
19:21
all systems and whether you do it manually you have very distinct breakdown categories so I'm not going to
19:27
get into to all of them there but they're up there on the screen and then what you can do is you could further
19:32
break it down that okay say like I said over in Canada art department is sets
19:39
set dressing Greenery props rule of thumb for a prop if an actor touches it
19:45
it's a prop so there's all these different categories that you're going to do is
19:50
break down and again in the early days you're doing it on your own you should be identifying everything but again as
19:55
your departmental keys become involved you can worry a little less because you know they're just going to obsess over
20:01
like maybe three to five of these things in your other departments are going to obsess over the other ones right
20:08
so that's the video I showed earlier so worth mentioning here that these are all
20:14
color categorized and when I go into Celtics you'll see that and even when you do it manually as well that you can
20:20
see in this screen grab they're using specific colors for specific categories
20:25
we really like color and film we really really like to color code everything and
20:32
you'll see that like I said when we go into Celtics so let's go to
20:40
so let's begin breakdown um I chose an oldie Buddha goodie I chose Goodwill Hunting
20:47
um we have a connection with Boston our company recently joined forces with a group of companies called backlight and
20:54
they're based out of Boston and I'm a sucker for any movies that are shot in the fall like driving here and seeing
21:00
all these trees and stuff it's just like to me it's the golden hour season to shoot something in Autumn I chose this
21:07
too because I mean we know who Matt Damon are and Ben Affleck are now but
21:12
back then they were just filming finishing up school I mean given it was Harvard but they were Matt Damon was
21:19
finishing up school and it originally had a production budget of 10 million which is which is pretty modest by
21:25
American Standards and it went on to gross 225 million and it actually
21:30
started in Matt Damon's final playwriting class at Harvard it was only
21:36
supposed to be a one-act play he turned it into a feature he got Ben Affleck
21:41
involved he started shopping it around and originally the screenplay was bought for 675 thousand dollars with the
21:48
guarantee that if it ended up being produced Affleck and Damon would end up making another hundred thousand dollars
21:53
so in the beginning um not not ginormous numbers right like it was in Indy but it's interesting they
22:01
took the approach that Quentin Tarantino had done just a few years prior with Harvey Keitel that they knew that they
22:08
needed someone big attached to the film to secure more funding and it ended up being Mary Max who secured the funding
22:15
and it was uh good Robin Williams R.I.P love that man but he was so genius that
22:23
he negotiated a back-end deal that he ended up making so much more money than the rest of them when it eventually
22:29
grossed 225 million um so yeah that's the scene I've chosen a scene from there so what we're going
22:35
to do right now is we're going to watch the scene and then we're going to go into Celtics and we're going to take a look at that specific scene and we're
22:42
gonna do a little bit of breakdown and then we're going to bring it through and we're going to look at the scheduling
22:48
and I was gonna we was gonna close the deal but then check uh Billy insulted one of them and
22:54
the heavy set girl said that I haven't had a receipt in Airline and I was a few pounds overweight and I was like go yourself
23:01
I swallowed a bug you're an idiot what you're an idiot
23:10
I've been sitting over there for 45 minutes waiting for you to come and talk to me but I'm tired now and I have to go
23:15
home and I couldn't sit there anymore waiting for you well I'm well Skyla
23:21
Skyla oh by the way that guy over there
23:28
yeah I know I kind of got that impression okay okay
23:34
gotta get up early and waste some more money on my overpriced education no I didn't mean you right sorry there's my
23:41
number so maybe we can go out for coffee sometime all right yeah maybe we could just get together and eat a bunch of
23:46
caramels what do you mean when you think about it says arbitrary he's drinking coffee
23:52
uh yeah okay oh
24:04
[Music]
24:14
[Music]
24:21
do you like apples yeah
24:28
well I got a number how do you like their Maps
24:39
um all right so let's stop here so we're going to Pivot here now and go
24:47
into Celtics
24:53
all right so let's do this all right so this is our
24:59
script editor nice thing about Celtics I was just able to find I couldn't find the shooting script actually to Goodwill
25:06
Hunting so this is one of the um original versions and as I read
25:11
through I noticed that like quite a bit changed on the day even in the scene that we're going to talk about so that's always interesting to see
25:18
um I have a sneaking suspicion that maybe some of it had to do with resourcing issues but you can import a
25:24
script of any type into Celtics and our system will read it and it will parse
25:30
out the scenes and your interiors and you're seeing headings so that's what I've done I've done here and here's your
25:37
scene nav so we're gonna jump to let's see here
25:45
let's jump to scene there we go scene 21 that's where we picked up in the film
25:50
so you you if you're going to begin your breakdown our breakdown is just simply
25:55
right here and we're going to go into breakdown mode Excuse excuse the the Wi-Fi here
26:05
we go so now we're in Breakdown mode so as you can see here's here's where
26:11
the colors start coming into play right so right off the bat
26:17
um this isn't the first scene in the bar but if it were the first scene whenever
26:22
you have a new set or a new location that's going to be super duper for your art Department to take a real herd
26:31
analysis on what it is that they're going to need is it going to be a set are they really going to shoot on
26:36
location and again another totally different topic of scouting hugely comes into play here as well so
26:44
as you can see what I've done um I've put in the bow and arrow as a
26:50
location because that is a breakdown category and then I've chosen at the bar and I've
26:56
made a production note here um because this is a white version that I have a note here of we have not locked
27:04
bar location and this is all just hypothetical if confirmed day two will be held in
27:10
parking lot outside TBD so again as you're moving this should be like a living breathing document for you right
27:16
that like you are making notes you can upload photos you can leave comments um and again this is a great way about
27:22
doing it digitally um I have a node here will sits with
27:28
Morgan I am making the Assumption here from the art Department that we're going to need glassware we're going to need
27:33
bears that is a prop because they're touching it so I'm marking it as a prop
27:39
then I'm going to go in and another part of it is character again when you get into your scheduling you need to know
27:45
What actors you have on the day another nice thing about Celtics is we automatically identify all your
27:51
characters in the scenes so you never have to manually go through and add your
27:56
characters every time um here's an interesting thing this is where it changed from this script to the
28:04
shooting script so here they have them playing bar basketball where the players
28:09
shoot miniature balls at a small basket in the background occasionally we hear Chucky shouting Larry
28:16
um that didn't end up happening in the scene sometimes I wonder if maybe they could not Source a basketball game like
28:23
the mini basketball miniature ball machine I don't know but they ended up just going more simplistic and having
28:30
Matt Damon's character just sit at the bar and have many drivers character Skyler just approach and then we get
28:36
into dialogue again dialogue when you're doing breakdown isn't incredibly
28:41
important because if there's an action if there's a prop in it that's going to be noted outside the dialogue so here
28:48
here is like the the ultimate prop in that scene that carries over into the next scene it's that folded piece of
28:55
paper right that is clearly a prop I did also notice that
29:00
many driver had a sweater in her hand and that's where things sometimes get murky for me because it's wardrobe but
29:06
it's in her hands like is it a prop how does that work but just note it make a
29:12
note of it um you know things can change on the day as well um here's another really good example in
29:18
dialogue we're pausing outside the dialogue and he's indicating to a clock on the wall so that's going to be set
29:25
dressing so we're going to mark that as a category as well so you kind of go through this I did a couple scenes I
29:32
went to the ski the the scene outside the next one scene 22 the exterior of the bow and arrow we see that that prop
29:41
note again also making note that he has to be able to pound on glass that's
29:47
going to be a set dressing thing of whatever location you end up at also important
29:54
sometimes you'll say for example our boys um so you should be going ahead and
30:01
noting there what characters those are if they're not specifically listed
30:06
so after you do all of that what you end up with you can move over
30:13
here to the report section and we're going to go down to the scenes that I worked on that you start getting a list
30:19
of everything that you need and what category it's in so again this can be
30:24
exported at PDF once you get it all done it is it's fully fleshed out
30:32
so what we're gonna do here is then I'm going to show you
30:37
[Music] just one minute here I'm going to go back to the script
30:42
we use a thing called catalog which we find incredibly helpful so what our
30:48
catalog does and ultimately what you would end up at the end of your breakdown is you'd have a color-coded
30:54
report of sorts that would break down all your props like populated into one
31:01
section and then all your vehicle needs everything that it's like kind of like
31:07
your library of everything that you need for the film and again that also helps with scheduling because say you need the
31:12
same vehicle in five different scenes when you get into scheduling it's like okay well we can we can get this vehicle
31:18
for one day we should be shooting all of the scenes with that vehicle in that day
31:23
or over a few days so ultimately where you end up being is
31:29
you you get to create breakdown sheets so in that video clip that I showed you of George it did some cutaways there of
31:38
your breakdown sheet so where I've just done breakdown on just the scenes that I showed in the clip ultimately you would
31:45
have a multi-multi-page document of your breakdown this is this is the type of
31:51
document that you end up with and this is like a universal standard format it's not specific to Celtics you'll see it in
31:58
many other systems so you're going into your scene and then you're able to see quickly on the day I've scheduled this
32:05
to shoot I guess today October 27th and you see all your needs for that
32:13
particular scene and there's your eighths so we know that that is one and
32:18
six eighths of a page and we've got another 1 8 of a page and uh one and two
32:24
eighths of a page so by the end of the day end of shoot day one we got three seven eighths of a
32:31
page that's pretty good that's pretty fair because one of these scenes has pretty heavy dialogue between many
32:37
drivers character and Matt Damon's character that again your heavy dialogue scenes
32:43
um multi over the shoulder camera you should be accounting for many days and also good to note that that scene they
32:51
probably the scene with the slapping the notepad uh the the card on the glass
32:56
they probably had to shut down the street for that so that's something to keep in mind too when you're scheduling
33:01
your days right that there's going to be logistical needs and location needs
33:07
um so this is your breakdown report then what ends up happening is you get
33:12
to generate everything out of that then right um here's your strip board so in Celtics
33:19
this is just simply like a drag and drop so let's say hypothetically I could get
33:24
into the bow and arrow for one day so I went through and I chose all the scenes
33:30
that are shot in the bow and arrow and I chose the interior scenes first and
33:35
we're going to shoot day for night so we'll block out all the windows because then later in the day we got to do a set
33:43
shift to exterior bow and arrow and it needs to be night so even when you're scheduling within your day within your
33:49
location you should be thinking about the light you should be talking to your DP um and all that stuff so yeah this is
33:56
this is your strip board so again this is a huge um huge to do for your first 80 after
34:01
they complete the breakdown I mean really you you can you're investing a lot in your first ad they they have to
34:08
love a love a schedule love the logistics here you can put in the the
34:14
duration of how long you generally think it will take to shoot it or you can just go into your standard minimal view so
34:22
that's kind of like your standard view that you would see universally across the board regardless of what system you
34:28
use so then that turns into your calendar
34:33
days that you just start plopping in when you're gonna when you're gonna shoot what are your set shifts your unit
34:39
moves and then that ultimately starts becoming all these auto-generated
34:45
documents and that's the real kicker with Celtics is while you're working in the background doing your breakdown were
34:51
creating these documents for you so as you can see and again it's not a fully fleshed out I've only scheduled two
34:58
scenes but we start Auto populating your call sheet and you could have put all
35:03
this info in ahead of time and then you can distribute it via PDF be via email
35:10
you can export it to Google and as you go back and you rework on your script
35:16
say you want to do a quick rewrite on the scene the scene becomes longer all
35:21
you have to do is hit the sync button and this all simultaneously updates so
35:27
again we're taking that manual leg work out of the versioning and kind of going back and working on things
35:34
and as I mentioned your breakdown sheet that's kind of here if you ever go back
35:39
and and fuss with anything or change anything you just hit this resync button
35:44
[Music] um and you've got your breakdown sheet again so let's see if we can get back to the
35:51
catalog because that's where I wanted to show you the color coding
35:56
kind of the like I say it's it's like your library I don't know if you've ever worked on a
36:03
Film Production that you've seen someone walking around with a big fat black binder that's kind of the equivalent to
36:09
that it's it's that in digital form that it is literally every asset that you will need for your production and it
36:15
comes out of breakdown so there's not a whole pile here because I've just broken down two scenes but you
36:21
can imagine if you did a feature length film um this would be extremely fleshed out
36:26
and you'd have a lot of Assets in here so again this this gets worked all the
36:32
way down to a granular level I've got the props that I've done here Skyler's note you can go in you can write a
36:39
description you can leave comments if it's you know background information for
36:45
example or or actor information and then you can even get into budgeting so then
36:50
when you start your budgeting process you've already got some line items in there
36:56
um so again the the color coding and everything very crucial um kind of reminiscent to those cue
37:01
cards that I showed you earlier if you were doing it manually um so yeah that's that's essentially
37:08
breakdown that you take your time with it um be really really thorough
37:13
um feel good about it that you can sit down and only talk about the concept of your script with potential producers and
37:19
potential keys and ads but you like you logistically know your script too right
37:24
and you know that you've written it for the resources that you have and you've dug into that and you've done the
37:30
homework on it um and that that pretty much kind of
37:35
Clues it up so you know to recap like I said get your first ad involved as soon
37:40
as possible um keep an eye on your 1 8 as George mentioned your versioning and your
37:46
margins that's why it's so important to use a tool like Celtics you've got to pay attention to your
37:52
margins because like he said you could end up with a feature film having an extra day of shooting if you if you fuss
37:58
with your margins at all and you make those pages longer so always just stick to to a screenwriting tool
38:06
um or you know you could just use Celtics to complete your script your breakdown and and Beyond
38:11
so that's it for me as I mentioned you can reach out to me anytime we're going
38:17
to have some time for Q a here there's a QR code on the cards on your seats there
38:23
there's also one here for that trial and again like when I say Reach Out chat
38:29
with one of us here if you've got a project we're always looking to document filmmakers and their process always
38:36
looking for feedback and thanks for coming to the session
38:46
any any questions
38:55
are we still using sorry um why why are we still using type right
39:01
to font for our scripts why are we still using typewriter fonts I feel like
39:08
um well for one coming from a technical development background because I work on
39:13
the product teams at Celtics I can say for one when you get into writing in
39:19
multiple languages having one standardized font it's called it's called typeset for for exporting and
39:25
stuff I know that if we started changing our fonts and you're dealing with multiple languages and such like it's
39:31
just good to have one standard the other um more artistic opinion of mine is that
39:39
Hollywood loves a little bit of nostalgia and Romanticism so I just feel like they stick with that font because
39:45
it you know it is the typewriter font it's it's the the original
39:51
yeah yeah
40:00
hi um that was very informative thanks thank you for that um can you only use caltex while you're
40:08
online or can it be used offline good question so it's cloud-based but we do
40:13
have an offline version strictly for writing so right now it's it's something
40:20
we've recently developed right now if you're going to do breakdown or any of the the pre-production planning you
40:25
would have to be online for that but you can go offline while you're writing as well and you can use it on your mobile
40:31
device so like say you're you're on the tube or something and you lose your connection you don't have to worry about it you can keep writing and it will come
40:39
back up online thank you yeah
40:46
thank you if you have a script that's already been produced by another software
40:52
package will you be able to import it into Celsius yes that's something that
40:57
um in a very very early days we we were open source when we were desktop based
41:03
and we wanted to accept as many different formats as possible so it isn't a two-way street
41:10
um we import tons of different types including final draft but yes you can
41:15
bring it in and import it cool we're good all right thank you so much everybody
41:20
for coming really really appreciate it it's been great [Applause]
