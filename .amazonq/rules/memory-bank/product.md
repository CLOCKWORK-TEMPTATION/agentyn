# Product Overview

## Purpose
This project serves as a demonstration and testing environment for AI agent implementations using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It provides working examples of agent servers that can interact with AI systems through standardized protocols, showcasing both Python and TypeScript implementations.

## Key Features
- **Multi-Language Agent Examples**: Demonstrates agent implementation patterns in both Python and TypeScript
- **MCP Integration**: Full integration with Model Context Protocol SDK for standardized AI agent communication
- **LangChain Support**: Leverages LangChain framework for advanced agent orchestration and LLM interactions
- **Windows-Optimized Examples**: Includes Windows-specific agent implementations with proper path handling
- **Development Workspace**: Pre-configured workspace for rapid agent development and testing

## Target Users
- **AI/ML Developers**: Building intelligent agents and automation systems
- **Integration Engineers**: Implementing MCP-based agent communication protocols
- **Researchers**: Exploring agent architectures and multi-agent systems
- **DevOps Teams**: Automating workflows through AI-powered agents

## Use Cases
- Creating custom AI agents for specific automation tasks
- Testing MCP protocol implementations and integrations
- Learning agent development patterns and best practices
- Prototyping multi-agent systems with LangChain
- Building Windows-compatible agent solutions
